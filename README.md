# ‚òÑÔ∏è NOVA [WIP]

Nova is your next database web client and data analysis tool. It's a cross-platform,
good-loking web based app, written in React, Node.js and Docker.

- **Database client:** you will be able to connect to any kind of database, so you'll have all your
  connections in just one place. You can have multiple editors (sessions) with queries that
  are stored in the browser local storage. Currently supported databases: PostgreSQL.
  Soon: MongoDB, ElasticSearch...

- **Data analysis:** sometimes you need to export, process and analyze queries output. NOVA will
  let you export a query into a dataset, so you will be able to apply transformations,
  visualizations... or just download it as a CSV/JSON...

The main idead of using docker is to not to have any dependencies. You just pull and run the
docker image. That's all.
